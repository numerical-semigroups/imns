# International meetings on numerical semigroups (and applications)

These meetings started with a series of Iberian meetings

- [Iberian meeting on numerical semigroups - Porto 2008](https://cmup.fc.up.pt/cmup/ASA/numsgps_meeting/)
- [Iberian meeting on numerical semigroups - Granada 2010](https://www.ugr.es/local/imns2010)
- [Iberian meeting on numerical semigroups - Vila Real 2012](https://imns2012.utad.pt/)

and then they moved to Italy (thanks to Marco D'Anna and Enzo Micale, and to [INdAM](http://www.altamatematica.it/) and [CIRM](http://cirm.fbk.eu/)). 

Due to the CORONA crisis there was a gap in 2020, that meeting was planned to be hosted by the University of Cádiz (special thanks to Juan Ignacio García García)
